# Programming-and-Scripting---Project-April-2018
Repository for my research and analysis of the Fisher Irish data set. 


## Project Outline 

	The final assignment for the Programming & Scripting Module is a project based on the Fisher Iris data set.

	The data set was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository*

	The project entails researching the data set, writing Python code based on that research and writing concise documentation based on our findings.
	
	The Fisher Iris data set was originally compiled in 1936 by Ronald Fisher for his paper "THE USE OF MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS IN TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS"**.

	This data set was most likely selected as it is a real data set rather than a sythetic/simulated data set and relates to a topic that is easily articulated to non-statisticians/biologists.


## Objectives

	The project instruction document has given us some well signposted objectives that we should achieve through this project.

	1. Research background information about the data set and write a summary about it.
	2. Keep a list of references you used in completing the project.
	3. Download the data set and write some Python code to investigate it.
	4. Summarise the data set by, for example, calculating the maximum, minimum and mean of each column of the data set. A Python script will quickly do this for you.
	5. Write a summary of your investigations.
	6. Include supporting tables and graphics as you deem necessary.

	In addition to the objectives that we are graded on, we should also develop a better understanding of:
	1. the importance of consise and well commented code - this is particularly relevant when carrying out work that is time sensitive as it can significantly spped up the process.
	2. how to develop a clear audit trail that allows other users to follow our thought process and potentially pick up and continue our work if needed.
	3. what tools are best suited to communicate results - text/graphics/tables etc. 
	It is vital that my findings can be communicated in a manner that can be adapted depending on my audience (i.e. for a technical or non-technical viewer) as this would reflect real world working conditions.

## Introduction

	The Fisher Iris data set was originally compiled in 1936 by Ronald Fisher for his paper "THE USE OF MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS IN TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS"**.

	The data set itself is relatively small with a total of 150 observations (50 observations for each of 3 different species of Iris, with 4 different measurements taken for each observation). This gives 600 model points with which to work.

	The variants of Iris from which measurements were taken are the Iris Selosa, Iris versicolor and Iris virginica.

	The 4 measurments taken are sepal length, sepal width, petal length and petal width.

	The Iris data set is what is known as a Multivariate data set, that is the data set contains two or more variable quantities. 

	When considering a Multivariate data set, it is important to ensure that due consideration is given to potential spurious correlations*** which could give rise to incorrect inferrences about the data set in our analysis.

Spurious correlations are those where two variables are incorrectl deemed to be causally related to each other.
