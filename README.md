# Programming-and-Scripting---Project-April-2018
Repository for my research and analysis of the Fisher Irish data set. 


The data set was sourced from the UCI Machine Learning repository*

The data set was originally compiled in 1936 by Ronald Fisher for his paper "THE USE OF MULTIPLE MEASUREMENTS IN TAXONOMIC PROBLEMS"**.

Notable features of the data set are:

-  the small number of observations in the data set (only 150 data points)
-  use of a simple real data set rather than a synthetic data set on a topic easily articulated to non-biologists/statisticians.
